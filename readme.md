# My Image Corpus

For a long time now I've hacked together collections of images for projects. Each time I toss away the image set when I am down only to find myself looking for those images later. This repo aims to solve that by becoming my database for image sets. While this repo does serve the front end, really it is the database. Maybe someday it won't be one long file.

See [Image Corpus React App](https://github.com/mcwhittemore/image-corpus-react-app) for the JS code served here.
